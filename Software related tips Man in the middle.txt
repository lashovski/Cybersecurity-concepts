Every time when we will use Man in The middle software or attack we have to enable ip forwarding
command: --- echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward

execution python (program_name.py) -t (Target IP) -g (Gateway IP)

Note that if the target uses network with strong firewall it may be difficult and you shoud modify your attack!

Good luck! :)
